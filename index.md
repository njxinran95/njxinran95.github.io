### Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
I conducted multiple data analysis projects by using **R** and **Python**, and focused on interpreting, engineering data and building models with the principles of **machine learning**. My projects response to the solutions for real-world concerns in **resource allocation**.

[Bike share space-time prediction, Philadelphia](/pdf/Ran Xin-Bike share prediction.html)

The algorithm model aims to predict Indego bike share demand in Philadelphia by taking time, physical and socio-economic factors into account. The model can assist Indego to better allocate bike resources based on demand varying across **time and space**.

[EMS call prediction, Virginia Beach](/pdf/Ran Xin-EMS-call-prediction.html)

With existing EMS call records data, this project predicted space and time distribution of future EMS calls by adopting **Poisson Regression** and **Linear Regression**, and an **APP wireframe** was also developed for ambulance drivers by providing the fastest route to direct to the right place based on modeling results.

[Retail theft risk prediction, Chicago](/pdf/Ran Xin-Risk prediction for retail theft.html)

This project predicts retail theft risk in Chicago based on crime records and various risk factors, and also figures out potential risk hotspots.

[Larcerny index prediction, San Francisco](https://njxinran95.github.io/xin_he_finalproject)

The **Python** project predicts larcerny risk in San Francisco by using "larceny index" as the dependent variable. It includes a variety of interactive visuals for exploratory analysis and modeling.

### Spatial Analysis
I equipped myself with **ArcGIS** to conduct spatial analysis for different topics in city and regional planning. 

- [TOD analysis in Philadelphia](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW1_1.pdf)

Evaluated the feasibility of TOD along SEPTA metro lines in Philadelphia

- [Urban Growth Boundary in Lancaster County](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW2_1.pdf)

Explored the effects of Urban Growth Boundary on building densities and land use

- [Urban Growth VS. Development Suitability](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW3_1.pdf)

Analyzed the environmental sensitivity of land in Pennsylavnia to assess furture development through raster overlays

### Cartographic Design 
My skill also sets in cartographic design with the ability to complete the cartography in a GIS setting. 

- **Basemap**: East Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia

- **Basemap**: Phoenixville Borough, PA
<img src="images/Ran Xin-Phoenixville base map-01.jpg?raw=true"/>
- **Map visualization**: Hong Kong water supply system

### Graphics
With a working knowlege of Adobe Creative Suite, I performed various graphic works. The following images are made in **Adobe Illustrator**.

- **Infographics** for selected demographics of East Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia

- **Diagram for Net Zero Water** 
<img src="images/Infographic-NetZeroWater.png?raw=true"/>
- **Miscellaneous icons**
