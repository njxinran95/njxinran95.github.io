### Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
I conducted multiple data analysis projects by using **R** and **Python**, and focused on interpreting, engineering data and building models with the principles of **machine learning**. My projects response to the solutions for real-world concerns in **resource allocation**.

[Bike share space-time prediction, Philadelphia](/pdf/Ran Xin-Bike share prediction.html)

The algorithm model aims to predict Indego bike share demand in Philadelphia by taking time, physical and socio-economic factors into account. The model can assist Indego to better allocate bike resources based on demand varying across **time and space**.

[EMS call prediction, Virginia Beach](/pdf/Ran Xin-EMS-call-prediction.html)

With existing EMS call records data, this project predicted space and time distribution of future EMS calls by adopting **Poisson Regression** and **Linear Regression**, and an **APP wireframe** was also developed for ambulance drivers by providing the fastest route to direct to the right place based on modeling results.

[Retail theft risk prediction, Chicago](/pdf/Ran Xin-Risk prediction for retail theft.html)

This project predicts retail theft risk in Chicago based on crime records and various risk factors, and also figures out potential risk hotspots.

[Larcerny index prediction, San Francisco](https://njxinran95.github.io/xin_he_finalproject)

The Python project predicts larcerny risk in San Francisco by using "larceny index" as the dependent variable. It includes a variety of interactive visuals for exploratory analysis and modeling.

### Spatial Analysis
I also equipped myself with ArcGIS to work on spatial analysis with a focus on visualization trough map renderings:

- [TOD analysis in Philadelphia](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW1_1.pdf)
- [Urban Growth Boundary in Lancaster County](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW2_1.pdf)
- [Urban Growth VS. Development Suitability](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW3_1.pdf)
