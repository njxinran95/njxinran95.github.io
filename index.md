### Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
I conducted multiple data analysis projects by using **R**, and focused on interpreting, engineering data and building models with the principles of **machine learning**. My projects response to the solutions for real-world concerns in **resource allocation**.

[Bike share space-time prediction, Philadelphia](/pdf/Ran Xin-Bike share prediction.html)
The algorithm model aims to predict Indego bike share demand in Philadelphia by taking time, physical and socio-economic factors into account. The model can assist Indego to better allocate bike resources based on demand varying across **time and space**.

### Spatial analysis
I also equipped myself with ArcGIS to work on spatial analysis with a focus on visualization trough map renderings:

- [TOD analysis in Philadelphia](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW1_1.pdf)
- [Urban Growth Boundary in Lancaster County](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW2_1.pdf)
- [Urban Growth VS. Development Suitability](/pdf/Ran Xin-590 HW3_1.pdf)
